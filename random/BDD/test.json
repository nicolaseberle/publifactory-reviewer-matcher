Recent data appear to support a paradigm shift toward neoadjuvant chemotherapy with interval debulking surgery (NACT-IDS). We hypothesized that stage IV ovarian cancer patients would likely benefit from NACT-IDS by achieving similar outcomes with less morbidity. Patients with stage IV epithelial ovarian cancer who underwent primary treatment between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2007, were identified. Data were retrospectively extracted. Each patient record was evaluated to subclassify stage IV disease according to the sites of tumor dissemination at the time of diagnosis. The Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used to compare overall survival (OS) data. A total of 242 newly diagnosed stage IV epithelial ovarian cancer patients were included in the final analysis; 176 women (73%) underwent PDS, 45 (18%) NACT-IDS, and 21 (9%) chemotherapy only. The frequency of achieving complete resection to no residual disease was significantly higher in patients with NACT-IDS versus PDS (27% vs. 7.5%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). When compared to women treated with NACT-IDS, women with PDS had longer admissions (12 vs. 8\u00a0days; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), more frequent intensive care unit admissions (12% vs. 0%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and a trend toward a higher rate of postoperative complications (27% vs. 15%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.08). The patients who received only chemotherapy had a median OS of 23\u00a0months, compared to 33\u00a0months in the NACT-IDS group and 29\u00a0months in the PDS group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.1). NACT-IDS for stage IV ovarian cancer resulted in higher rates of complete resection to no residual disease, less morbidity, and equivalent OS compared to PDS.","pdfUrls":[],"pmid":"21994038v1","s2PdfUrl":"","s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/4cbba8127c8747a3b2cfb9c1f48c43e5c15e323e","sources":["Medline"],"title":"Primary Debulking Surgery Versus Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Stage IV Ovarian Cancer","venue":"Annals of Surgical Oncology","year":2011.0}
